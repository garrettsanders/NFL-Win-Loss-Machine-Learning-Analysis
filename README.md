# NFL-Win-Loss-Machine-Learning-Analysis
As a group we decided to a deep dive on fantasy football statistics from the 2019/20 season. Our project was filled with diverse topics such as:

1) Football Weather: Does weather have an impact on teams potentially winning or losing games? For this question we did a deep dive using machine learning DecisionTreeClassifier() model
and a linear Regression model to predict whether theweather elements had any sort of impact determining final scores of games.

2) Mapping the Football Stadium coordinates via Tableau

3) Deep Dive on Running Backs: How exactly do running backs score in fantasy football? This visualization will tell the story of how running backs get their fantasy points each week by comparing 
on average whether running backs score their touchdowns by running the ball or recieving the ball, and which one scores more points from the fantasy perspective.

4) Deep dive on defenses: Defenses score most of their fantasy points via turnovers and points scored against them. We deep dive on which teams do this the best and how each statistic coorelates to their weekly
fantasy score. 

5) In another visualization about defense, we use machine learning to predict how well a defense performs depending on whether or not they are at home or playing in an away stadium. 

6) Visualization to determine the best running back in the fantasy football world. This visualization looks at whether the best running back purely just runs the ball, or if he is a duel threat with running the football, as well
as running routes and receiving.

7) Deep dive into the top 10 fantasy scorers by postion (QB, RB, WR, TE, Defense, K): Pie chart developed in Matplotlib giving a comparsion of which 10 top players of each postion scored the most fantasy
points per week on average. In addition, a top 10 player breakdown by player to see the highs and lows of each top position, and which one will perform best for you fantasy team on a weekly basis.

8) Starting QBs average fantasy points: Based on the number of games played, this visualization made in Tableau looks the at the Starting Qbs in the NFL and compares their average fantasy scores on a weekly basis.

9) Deep dive on kickers: Bar chart developed in Matplotlib to see which players had the highest field goal percentages in the league.

10) Defense scatter plot: This shows a different visual to comprehend the differences in defensive fantasy points on average on a weekly basis. 

11) Kicker Bar and Line Chart: Made with Matplotlib showing the top kickers of the NFL based on their fantasy points for the season.
